# Pretty-Cool-Logo-Generator

## Description

In this project, I was required to create an app that creates a logo through user inputs. The logo is stored as 'logo.svg' in the examples directory after the user is done specifying a 3 character string, text color (color name/color code), shape (circle,triangle, square), and shape color (color name/color code). I have provided an example logo in the examples directory of this repo!

I experienced a lot of troubles with what dependencies and trying to test out the jest for my text inputs so I decided to leave that out.

## Usage

This app requires the use of Node.js in VSCode! I went through a lot of dependencies because I didn't know what would work, but I installed and used canvas/shapes/svg-canvas(to be able to generate an image), inquirer, and jest (to test the constructors) By typing 'node index.js' into the terminal, you will be prompted to answer a series a questions that will be used to create the logo.
